# Hi, I'm Fiorella (Fio)

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I‚Äôm Fiorella, but most people call me Fio. I‚Äôm a student of Development of Multiplatform Applications (DAM) and am currently diving into the exciting world of programming.

## üöÄ About Me

- **Education**: I am studying DAM, with a focus on Java. I also have experience with PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and AJAX. For databases, I work with MySQL and MongoDB.
- **Analytical Philosophy**: Before venturing into programming, I graduated in Analytical Philosophy. This background has provided me with a unique perspective on critical thinking and problem-solving.

### Fun Anecdote
Once, during a coding marathon, I was struggling with a bug that I just couldn't resolve. After much searching, I realized the issue was a simple missing curly brace (`{`). Sometimes the smallest errors can be the hardest to find!

## üåü Goals

In this repository, I plan to:

- **Share My Learnings**: I will publish my practice projects, exercises, and experiments as I continue to learn and improve my skills.
- **Explore New Technologies**: I intend to explore new tools and technologies and share my discoveries and experiences.
- **Collaborate and Contribute**: I hope to contribute to open-source projects and collaborate with other developers to continue growing within the community.

## üìö Resources and Learnings

As I progress in my studies and projects, I will share useful resources and what I‚Äôm learning. If you're interested in following my progress or collaborating, feel free to follow me and get in touch.
